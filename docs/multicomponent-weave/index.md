# Multi-Component Weave
Designed By: Shanel Wu

![Overview of Multi-Component Weave and different press states][final]

## Loom: Schacht Baby Wolf (8-shaft)

## Yarns
- 10/2 Pearl cotton in black and white
- stainless steel (SS) conductive yarn
- dyed thermochromic cotton-covered (CC) copper conductive yarn

## Function
This Multi-Component Weave design shows how a woven smart textile can be a complete embedded system, handling real-time inputs and outputs to achieve a specific function. The weaving integrates a sensor input (pressure) and an output (color change) into the fabric structure, while creating a pocket for an external PCB (e.g. an Arduino microprocessor) to integrate processing. This mixture of techniques and materials demonstrates how the weaving process can be used to develop complex, multi-functional smart textiles. The color-changing region has been documented in other projects, but I describe the pressure sensor and pocket in more detail below.

### Pressure Sensor

The pressure sensor was created with a woven structure (stitch) called waffle weave. Waffle weave is a textured structure often used in towels because its airiness makes it highly absorbent. When woven using a conductive yarn along with a non-conductive yarn (I used stainless steel with 10/2 Pearl cotton yarn), the structure is highly resistive when uncompressed, and then decreases significantly in resistance when compressed. This pressure-sensing fabric references the work on this Kobakant page.

### Double Woven Pocket

The pocket was created using double weave. Double weaving is a class of woven structure that allows two layers of fabric to be woven simultaneously, making pockets, tunnels, and other topologies possible.
