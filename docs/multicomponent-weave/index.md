# Multi-Component Weave
Designed By: Shanel Wu

## Function
This Multi-Component Weave design shows how a woven smart textile can be a complete
embedded system, handling real-time inputs and outputs to achieve a specific function. The weaving integrates a sensor input (pressure) and an output (color change) into the fabric structure, while creating a pocket for an external PCB (e.g. an Arduino microprocessor) to integrate processing. This mixture of techniques and materials demonstrates how the weaving process can be used to
develop complex, multi-functional smart textiles. The color-changing region has been documented in other projects, but I describe the pressure sensor and pocket in more detail below.

### Pressure Sensor

The pressure sensor is created with a woven structure (stitch) called waffle weave. Waffle weave is a textured structure often used in towels because its airiness makes it highly absorbent. When
