# Text To Weave
- Designed by [Nathalia Campreguer](https://github.com/nathcampreguer) 
- In Collaboration with Tali Weinberg and [Laura Devendorf](https://github.com/devendork) 

## Summary 
This interface translates text into woven structures. Specifically, each character of text is translated into a unique twill block. The code ensures that the fabric is well formed (e.g. no long floats) and includes selvedge. We built this tool specifically to use in the "Weaving Climate Datascapes" workshop held in collaboration with Tali Weinberg at the Unstable Design Lab in 2019. 


## Equipment Specifics
This interfacegenerates files specifically for a 3W TC2 Digital Jacquard Loom warped at 30 epi. Files were tested when we had our loom warped with 20/2 pearl cotton. 

## Yarns
* We threw a variety of shuttles, including 5/2 pearl cottons, chenille and 3/8 zephyr wool. The wools have a particularly nice effect due to their fuzziness.
