String Figure Sensor
Designed by Jolie Klefeker and Laura Devendorf

Summary
We used a knitted tubular structure and integrated resistive wiritng into the sheath and core in order to create a sort of pipe-cleaner type object whose shape could be sensed through resistive sensing. 

Equipment Specifics
i-cord knitting 
resistive yarn
cotton covered wire
copper tape
enamel covered magnet wire (roughtly 26 AWG)

Yarns
We used wool yarn, which gave it a nice squishi-ness. 




##String Figure Sensor
A vision for astring that knows something of its own shape

In one project, we used conductive materials in the core AND the sheath to create a string that would know something of its own shape. It did so by adding five different insulated conductive wires inside the structure. Each insulated wire was then attached to a exposed conductive "ring" made of copper tape. This allowed us to take resistance measurements at five different points along the length. Depending on which sensors showed changes in resistance and which didn't, we could tell which regions of the string were crossed.
