# String Figure Sensor
- Designed by Jolie Klefeker and [Laura Devendorf](https://github.com/devendork) 

## Summary 
We used a knitted i-cord structure and integrated resistive wiritng into the sheath and core in order to create a sort of pipe-cleaner type object whose shape could be sensed through resistive sensing. 


## Equipment Specifics
hands and knitting needles or an embellishment i-cord knitter

## Yarns
wool yarn
statex resistive thread (we believe, its quite old so we don't know exactly which)
cotton covered wire sourced from wires.co.uk
copper tape
enamel covered magnet wire (roughly 26 AWG)
